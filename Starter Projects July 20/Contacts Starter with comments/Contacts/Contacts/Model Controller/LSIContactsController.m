 If you need to find the name of the automatically generated header file for the Swift you want to use in your Obj-C code, it is going to be the name of your project and "-Swift.h".
 For example "Journal-Swift.h".
 If your project has spaces in the name, they will be converted to underscores instead. For example, the header made for the project named "Hybrid Star Wars Search" would be "Hybrid_Star_Wars_Search-Swift.h".
